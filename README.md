## How to run the Game

Run `yarn install` to install required project dependencies

Run `node src\main.js` to run the game and output would be displayed on the console.

Run `yarn test` to run the Golden Master Tests.

## How to generate the Golden Master Tests

Run `node golden_master/golden_master_generator.js` to generate the Golden Master Records (the master_record_xxx.txt files). 

The number of master records is controlled by the `NUMBER_OF_MASTER_RECORDS` constant defined in `golden_master_helper.js`.
